# Railway Deployment Fix

## Problem
Railway deployment is crashing due to a syntax error in dashboard-system.js at line 1892 where there's duplicate HTML content.

## Solution
The syntax error has been fixed in the current Replit environment. The dashboard-system.js file no longer contains the problematic duplicate HTML content.

## What was fixed
- Removed duplicate HTML content around line 1892 in dashboard-system.js
- The line that was causing the error: `<h3>🏆 Leaderboard</h3>` has been removed
- The file now has proper JavaScript syntax throughout

## To deploy the fix to Railway
1. Push the current version of dashboard-system.js to your Railway deployment
2. The bot should start properly after the deployment

## Current Status
✅ Bot is running successfully in Replit
✅ Syntax error fixed in dashboard-system.js
✅ All dependencies installed
✅ MongoDB connection working
✅ Web server running on port 3000
✅ QR code generation working

## Next Steps
You need to manually push the fixed files to Railway or re-deploy from the current repository state.
