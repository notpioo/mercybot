# WhatsApp Bot

## Overview

This is a WhatsApp bot application built with Node.js using the Baileys library for WhatsApp integration and MongoDB for data persistence. The bot provides a command-based interface for interacting with users through WhatsApp messages, supporting both private and group chats.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **WhatsApp Interface**: The bot communicates through WhatsApp using the Baileys library
- **QR Code Terminal**: Uses qrcode-terminal for authentication display
- **No traditional web frontend**: All interactions happen through WhatsApp messages

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js Runtime**: Main application server
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Uses WhatsApp socket events for message handling
- **Command Pattern**: Modular command system for extensibility
- **Middleware Pattern**: Message preprocessing and validation

### Database Layer
- **MongoDB**: Primary database using Mongoose ODM
- **User Management**: Stores user profiles, command usage statistics, and permissions
- **Group Management**: Tracks group information and participant data
- **Session Management**: Handles WhatsApp authentication state

## Key Components

### Core Components
1. **WhatsApp Client** (`lib/whatsapp.js`)
   - Manages WhatsApp socket connection
   - Handles authentication and reconnection logic
   - Processes incoming messages and connection updates

2. **Message Handler** (`lib/messageHandler.js`)
   - Routes messages to appropriate commands
   - Manages user context and permissions
   - Handles command parsing and validation

3. **Database Layer** (`lib/database.js`)
   - User and group data models
   - Database connection management
   - CRUD operations for user/group entities

4. **Command System** (`commands/`)
   - Modular command structure
   - Owner commands for bot management
   - Menu system for user guidance

5. **Configuration** (`config/config.js`)
   - Centralized configuration management
   - Bot settings and message templates
   - MongoDB connection strings

### Command Architecture
- **Owner Commands**: Admin-only functionality (owner contact)
- **General Commands**: Available to all users (menu, help)
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new commands through the commands directory

### Authentication System
- **Multi-file Auth State**: Persistent WhatsApp session management
- **Owner Verification**: Role-based access control
- **User Tracking**: Automatic user registration and activity logging

## Data Flow

1. **Message Reception**: WhatsApp message received through Baileys socket
2. **Message Processing**: Extract text, sender info, and chat context
3. **User Management**: Create/update user record in MongoDB
4. **Command Parsing**: Extract command and arguments from message
5. **Command Execution**: Route to appropriate command handler
6. **Response Generation**: Format and send response back to WhatsApp
7. **Logging**: Track command usage and user activity

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@whiskeysockets/baileys**: WhatsApp Web API client
- **mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling
- **qrcode-terminal**: QR code display for authentication

### Database
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud-hosted MongoDB instance
- **Connection String**: Configured for cluster0.feboa.mongodb.net

### WhatsApp Integration
- **Baileys Library**: Handles all WhatsApp protocol communication
- **Multi-device Support**: Compatible with WhatsApp multi-device architecture
- **Session Persistence**: Maintains login state across restarts

## Deployment Strategy

### Process Management
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles SIGINT signals properly
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and logging
- **Auto-restart**: Reconnection logic for network failures

### Session Management
- **Local Session Storage**: Stores auth state in ./sessions directory
- **Persistent Authentication**: Maintains login between restarts
- **QR Code Generation**: Fallback authentication method

### Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Supports environment-based configuration
- **Default Values**: Fallback configuration for development
- **Centralized Config**: Single source of truth for all settings
